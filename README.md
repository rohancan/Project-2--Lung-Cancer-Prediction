# Project-2--Lung-Cancer-Prediction

Objective: The main objective of this project is to analyze this lung cancer dataset and develop a predictive model to accurately identify individuals with a higher risk of developing lung cancer based on various factors such as age, smoking, chronic disease, wheezing and other related attributes. This model can be used as a tool for early diagnosis of lung cancer and help the healthcare professionals in identifying the high-risk cancer patients, leading to improved patient outcomes.

Hypothesis: A good hypothesis to prove or disprove in this case might be the following â€“ Smoking is the strongest predictor of lung cancer and other factors such as age, chronic disease and wheezing have a lesser impact on the development of lung cancer.

To test the hypothesis, a statistical analysis could be performed to determine the correlation between each attribute and the occurrence of lung cancer, as well as the strength of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer relative to other attributes. Basically, the objective is to build a predictive model to see how accurately it can predict the occurrence of lung cancer based on the different attributes, with the focus on the impact of smoking as a predictor.
